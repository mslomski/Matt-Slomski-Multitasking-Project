*******************************************************************************
-IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure you set the folder and files to permission 777! You had a problem
where the file was not being created because you did not have write permissions!
*******************************************************************************
- NOTE: to pass the first form info to the final script you need to put in the result.php
form a bunch of hidden fields that store the values of the factors.php form.
Then you can just copy what you did before and send the data to the script!

- **************
Make the output a .xml file instead of a .txt file. Also make tags in it like in w3 schools for an xml doc.
You want <filename>date</filename><Age>Age</Age> and so on in order to make it easy to convert it to a database version!
