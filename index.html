 <center><h3>Research project goal, hypothesis, research question, or purpose:</h3></center>
 <p><b>The goal of this research is to assess the impact of multitasking with technology. 
 This goal is two-phased, with the first phase dealing with refining a 
 previously developed conceptual model leading to the generation of 
 concrete propositions and hypotheses. And the second phase dealing with 
 designing experiments to test the hypotheses from the conceptual model in 
 an academic setting. </b></p>

 <p><b>
 In today's digital world 'multitasking', i.e., doing more than one thing at 
 a time has become a norm with all of us and especially college-level students
  across the world. The College at Brockport is not an exception. Students 
  in classes are seen to be checking their email, logging onto social network 
  sites, playing online games, etc. At the same time, they are also seen to be 
  sending text messages on their hand-held devices, and "listening" to the 
  in-class lectures. How effective are they at simultaneously managing all 
  these activities? Is this really multitasking? Are we really increasing 
  efficiency? Or is this hindering our ability to do our job well? Is it changing 
  our thinking, shortening our attention span? Many such questions arise and there 
   no simple answers. Psychologists are of the opinion that it is not possible for 
   the brain to focus on more than one activity at a time to be most effective and 
   to perform at the person's full capability. There has been some preliminary research 
   on the topic that shows that a person's effectiveness and productivity falls as they 
   multitask - yet people in various contexts such as in work and study environments 
   continue to do so. In this study, we will extend this research to refine a previously 
   developed conceptual model with recent findings on the topic. We then plan to develop 
   hypotheses from the model that we will test in an academic setting i.e. within a 
   classroom environment to assess student performance. On analyzing the findings from 
   the experiments, we hope that our research will help to farther the knowledge of 
   multitasking with information technology by being able to provide recommendations 
   for appropriate compatible technology multitasking tools, environmental settings, 
   and student multitasking behavior to facilitate positive learning in the classroom. 
   Contributions from our research will also include strategies for Instructors that 
   can be utilized to incorporate this new trend in multitasking with technology 
   by students in their lesson planning and offering of content in the classroom 
   to foster positive learning environments and improved student engagement in learning.    
 </b></p>
 <p><b>
 The notion of multitasking has been around for a while but the prevalence of it in academic 
 settings has sky-rocketed with the advent and progress of numerous information technology tools and 
 applications and their use by the student population. The discipline of Information Systems deals with 
 understanding the usage and impact of technology in various contexts and includes units of analysis such 
 as at the organizational, academic, as well as the individualistic/personal level. Understanding whether 
 the social context drives the need for and subsequent use of specific technologies OR whether the mere 
 existence and availability of various technologies causes people to use them without real basis or true need, 
 is also a motivation for this research project and a very core aspect of our discipline of Information Systems. 
 This study is a very relevant and timely topic as technology is being developed and marketed and brought into 
 the hands of consumers - in our case, our students - without really assessing the true impact it might have 
 in their environments i.e. on their College learning experience.
